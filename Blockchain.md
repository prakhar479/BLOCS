# Blockchain Layer Overview for Decentralized Storage System

## 1. Introduction
The blockchain layer forms the foundation of the decentralized storage system. It manages critical functions such as distributed file storage, consensus, tokenomics, transaction verification, and maintaining the integrity of the network. This layer is designed to be scalable, secure, and optimized for peer-to-peer (P2P) interactions, without relying on centralized control.

## 2. Overall System Design

### 2.1 Components of the Blockchain Layer
The blockchain layer consists of the following components:
- **Nodes (Storage Providers)**: Machines contributing storage and maintaining blockchain operations.
- **Consensus Algorithm (Proof-of-Storage)**: A decentralized method for verifying that nodes store allocated file shards and ensuring blockchain security.
- **Native Token (Cryptocurrency)**: A token system to incentivize storage providers, handle payments for storage, and penalize unreliable nodes.
- **Transaction Pool**: Stores pending transactions (storage requests, payment transfers) awaiting inclusion in the next block.
- **Block Structure**: Defines how blocks are formed, including headers, file metadata, storage proofs, and transaction data.
- **Peer-to-Peer Network**: A decentralized communication protocol for broadcasting transactions, blocks, and storage challenges across nodes.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated contracts that govern storage agreements, file retrieval, and payment systems.

### 2.2 Blockchain Data Flow
1. **File Upload**: Users send file storage requests to the network, splitting files into shards and encrypting them. These requests are converted into transactions, broadcasted, and stored in the transaction pool.
2. **Block Formation**: Miners (storage nodes) collect transactions, validate them, and package them into blocks. Blocks contain file metadata, storage proofs, and transaction records.
3. **Consensus Validation**: Nodes engage in a **Proof-of-Storage (PoS)** mechanism to validate that they are storing file shards correctly. Once a node proves its storage integrity, the block is added to the blockchain.
4. **File Retrieval**: When users request files, nodes reconstruct the original files from stored shards by responding to retrieval requests.
5. **Rewards and Penalties**: Nodes earn tokens for proving storage and participating in the consensus. Unreliable nodes are penalized or removed from the network.

## 3. Internal Implementation Details

### 3.1 Block Structure

Each block in the blockchain has the following structure:

- **Block Header**:
  - **Block Height**: Sequential identifier for the block.
  - **Previous Block Hash**: Hash pointer to the previous block, ensuring immutability.
  - **Merkle Root**: The root hash of the Merkle tree for the transactions within the block.
  - **Storage Proof Root**: Root hash of storage proofs provided by nodes.
  - **Timestamp**: The time the block was created.
  - **Nonce**: A number used for consensus validation (Proof-of-Storage).
  
- **Block Body**:
  - **Transactions**: A list of transactions such as file storage requests, payments, and smart contract executions.
  - **Storage Proofs**: Cryptographic proofs from storage nodes, demonstrating that they hold the required data.
  - **File Metadata**: Information about the files stored (shard hashes, encryption keys, replication factor, etc.).

The **Merkle Tree** is used to efficiently validate the integrity of transactions and storage proofs. Merkle trees enable quick validation of whether a specific transaction or proof exists in the block without having to reprocess the entire block.

### 3.2 Consensus Mechanism: Proof-of-Storage

#### 3.2.1 Proof-of-Storage Design
The **Proof-of-Storage (PoS)** consensus mechanism allows nodes to prove that they are storing file shards accurately and securely. PoS involves the following steps:
- **Sharding**: Files are split into multiple encrypted shards. These shards are distributed across several nodes.
- **Storage Challenges**: At regular intervals, nodes are challenged to prove they still store the assigned file shards.
- **Response Protocol**: Nodes respond by submitting cryptographic proofs (e.g., Merkle proofs) that confirm the integrity and availability of the stored data.
- **Reward Distribution**: Nodes that successfully respond to the challenge receive rewards in native tokens. Nodes that fail are penalized.

#### 3.2.2 Proof Validation Process
1. **Challenger Node**: A random node is selected as the "challenger" and is responsible for initiating the storage challenge.
2. **Proof Generation**: Storage nodes generate cryptographic proofs (e.g., a hash of the stored data shard combined with a random nonce).
3. **Validation**: The challenger node and others in the network verify the proof.
4. **Block Creation**: Once a storage proof is validated, the node is allowed to include a new block in the chain, containing storage proofs and transactions.
  
### 3.3 Tokenomics and Transactions

#### 3.3.1 Native Token
The blockchain has its own native cryptocurrency that facilitates payments for storage and retrieval services. It is also used to incentivize nodes to participate in storing and validating data.

#### 3.3.2 Transaction Types
The following types of transactions are supported:
- **Storage Transactions**: Initiated by users to store files on the network, specifying the amount of storage required and the duration.
- **Payment Transactions**: Transfer tokens between users, storage providers, and the blockchain system.
- **Retrieval Transactions**: Requests made by users to retrieve previously stored files from the network.
- **Smart Contract Execution**: Automatically executed when conditions such as storage payment or retrieval are met.

#### 3.3.3 Transaction Flow
1. **User Submits Transaction**: The user creates a transaction to store or retrieve data.
2. **Transaction Pool**: The transaction is broadcast to the network and stored in the transaction pool.
3. **Node Validation**: Storage nodes validate the transaction, ensuring that the user has sufficient tokens to pay for the requested services.
4. **Inclusion in Block**: Once validated, the transaction is included in a new block, and the blockchain is updated.

### 3.4 Node Reputation System

To incentivize reliability and penalize unreliable nodes, the blockchain implements a **node reputation system**:

1. **Reputation Score**: Each storage node has a reputation score based on factors like:
   - Successful storage proof responses
   - Uptime and availability
   - File retrieval success rate
2. **Penalties**: Nodes that fail to respond to storage challenges, exhibit low uptime, or lose file shards will have their reputation lowered and may face penalties (e.g., reduced rewards, increased challenge frequency).
3. **Incentives**: Nodes with high reputation scores receive additional rewards, lower challenge frequencies, and priority when users are selecting storage providers.

### 3.5 File Storage and Versioning

#### 3.5.1 Sharding and Replication
- **File Sharding**: Files are divided into multiple encrypted shards, ensuring that no single node has access to the entire file.
- **Replication**: Each shard is replicated across several nodes for redundancy, using **erasure coding** techniques such as Reed-Solomon coding to ensure data can be reconstructed even if some nodes go offline.
  
#### 3.5.2 File Updates and Versioning
- **Version Control**: Each file stored on the network is assigned a version number. When a file is updated, only the differences between the new and old versions (deltas) are stored, reducing overhead.
- **Delta Encoding**: Implemented to store only the changes between file versions rather than full copies of each version. This optimizes storage use for frequently updated files.
- **Metadata Updates**: When file shards or versions are updated, the blockchain records the new file metadata (hashes, shard locations, etc.) in a new block.

### 3.6 Peer-to-Peer Networking

The blockchain relies on a **peer-to-peer (P2P) network** for communication between nodes. Key features of the P2P layer include:

- **Node Discovery**: Nodes discover each other using a decentralized node discovery protocol (e.g., **Kademlia DHT**).
- **Gossip Protocol**: Blocks and transactions are propagated through the network using a gossip protocol, ensuring fast dissemination of new data.
- **Efficient Storage Proof Challenges**: Nodes communicate directly with each other to issue and respond to storage proof challenges.
- **File Retrieval**: When a user requests a file, nodes holding the necessary shards communicate with each other to reconstruct and deliver the file to the user.

---

### 3.7 Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are used to automate key processes in the blockchain:
- **Storage Agreements**: Contracts between users and nodes that define the terms of storage (amount, duration, cost).
- **Payment Automation**: Smart contracts ensure that storage providers are automatically paid when they fulfill their storage obligations.
- **File Retrieval Agreements**: Contracts that facilitate file retrieval by automating payments and shard delivery.

## 4. Conclusion

The blockchain layer is designed to manage file storage, incentivize node participation, and ensure data integrity through a decentralized, peer-to-peer system. With the combination of Proof-of-Storage, a robust token system, and smart contracts, the system ensures that data is securely stored, updated, and retrieved in a fully decentralized manner, without relying on any central authority.
